The Tech Academy Python Final Drill Drill Description:

The script provides the user with a graphical user interface that includes two buttons allowing the 
user to browse their own system and select a source directory and a destination directory. The script  shows
those selected directory paths in their own corresponding text fields.

Also, the script  provides a button for the user to execute a function that should iterate through the source 
directory, checking for the existence of any files that end with a “.txt” file extension and if so, cut the qualifying files 
and paste them within the selected destination directory.

In addition to the above, the script records the file names that were moved and their corresponding modified time-stamps 
into a database and print out those text files and their modified time-stamps to the console.
